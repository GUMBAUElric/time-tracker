Here is the content of the lib folder containing the source files

```text
time_tracker/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base/ (contains the files that define the foundations of the application)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/ (store blocks that are more independent, like buttons)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/ (blocks that contain what is reusable)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/ (contains the models for data manipulation)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/ (contains the files that define the foundations of the application)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ router/ (used for navigation within the home page)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ store/ (implements flutter_redux to persist the data)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/ (contains the utility files)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart (entry point of the application)
```

## How its work

Most of the functionalities are implemented.

You can :

- Log in with any username
- Log out
- Add / Update / Delete a Task
- Filter tasks according to the dates of the current month

When you add a task, it must contain the following data:

- A name
- A priority
- A date
- A start time
- An end time

> **_NOTE:_** You can if you wish add users who will work on the task you create, you can add any name of any size.

Data persistence is done with the flutter_redux package.

Due to lack of time, here are the features that remains to be done :

- Internationalization with flutter
- Persist the data when the application is restarted
- Optimization

## How to install

- Open your emulator (ios or android)

- Open a terminal, go to the folder 'time_tracker' and type

      flutter run

> 'flutter run' launches the application

> it may take a while, be patient ! üëç

The application must launch and you arrive on the home page !
